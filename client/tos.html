<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	We can use your data however we see fit. You give your data out of your own
	free will. You have the right and ability to delete your account at any time.
	This privacy policy will be updated in the future to be more private, but we
	needed to make it all-encompassing for now so that we don't get sued.
