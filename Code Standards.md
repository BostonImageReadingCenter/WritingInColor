## The Three Standards of Good Code:

1. The code should be readable. Anyone should be able to look at portion of code and instantly know what it does, when it works, how it works, and why it works. It is better to be overly verbose than overly concise.
2. The code should be modular and extensible. You shouldn't see any blocks of code repeated many times in your codebase.
3. The code should be adaptable. It should be able to change to match its environment automatically. It should work no matter what is going on. It should adapt to strange circumstances. For client-side code, this means that the design should be responsive and adapt to any screen size from 10 pixels wide to ten billion. It should dynamically adjust itself to match any screen, platform, or environment.

## Organization:

The code should be reasonably and logically broken up and organized.
